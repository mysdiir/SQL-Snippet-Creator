# SQL-Snippet-Creator

## What is it about?
During my studies I had to start a project which included designing a database, create an ERM, create and fill the database with SQL.
We had a lot of time doing this project and due to little itching in my fingers, I had the idea making a SQL Snippet Creator for lazy people with JavaScript and PHP as a
webapp.
I know it took way longer time to create this webapp, but I wanted to do some PHP and JS after about 1.5 years of not programming with it and go more indepth it and yeah, why not? :P

## Project is done so far (at least backend related things)
The quality of this code might not be the best, but for starting getting indepth knowledge of PHP and JS it should be fine.
One of the major problems is, that I need to implement a few exepctions while input fields are not set.
But also due to the fact that I have a lot to do atm, I will rework this code to a cleaner one when the time is right :P
