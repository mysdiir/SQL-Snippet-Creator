# SQL-Snippet-Creator

## What is it about?
During my studies I had to start a project which included designing a database, create an ERM, create and fill the database with SQL.
We had a lot of time doing this project and due to little itching in my fingers, I had the idea making a SQL Snippet Creator for lazy people with JavaScript and PHP as a
webapp.
I know it took way longer time to create this webapp, but I wanted to do some PHP and JS after about 1.5 years of not programming with it and go more indepth it and yeah, why not? :P
